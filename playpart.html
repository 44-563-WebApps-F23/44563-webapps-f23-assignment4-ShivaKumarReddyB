            Mrs. Stockmann. Are you in, Thomas?

            Dr. Stockmann (from within his room). Yes, I have just come in. (Comes
            into the room.) What is it?
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. A letter from your brother.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Aha, let us see! (Opens the letter and reads:) "I return
            herewith the manuscript you sent me" (reads on in a low murmur) H'm!â€”
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. What does he say?
            
            Dr. Stockmann (putting the papers in his pocket). Oh, he only writes
            that he will come up here himself about midday.
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Well, try and remember to be at home this time.
