        <p>Are you in, Thomas?</p>

        <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
        <p>[from within his room.]</p>
        Yes, I have just come in.
        <p>[Comes into the room.]</p>
        What is it?

        <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p>A letter from your brother.</p>
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p>Aha, let us see!</p>
        <p>[Opens the letter and reads:]</p>
        "I return herewith the manuscript you sent me"
        <p>[reads on in a low murmur]</p>
        <p>H'm!â€”</p>

        <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p>What does he say?</p>

        <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
        <p>[putting the papers in his pocket].</p>
        <p>
          Oh, he only writes that he will come up here himself about midday.
        </p>

        <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p>Well, try and remember to be at home this time.</p>
